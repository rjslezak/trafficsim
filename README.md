# Traffic Simulation Using Livestream Footage

This is a project I have done for HCI/CPRE 575: Computational Perception

The goal was to simulate traffic using livestream footage provided by Iowa Department of Transportation.

The project is created in Unity3D and the video processing is done through OpenCV.
